Description: Analyze graph/network data using L1 centrality and prestige. Functions for deriving global and local L1 centrality/prestige and L1 centrality/prestige-based neighborhoods of vertices are provided. Routines for visual inspection of a graph/network are also provided. Details are in Kang and Oh (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.13233>.
